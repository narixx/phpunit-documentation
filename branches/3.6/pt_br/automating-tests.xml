  <title>Automating Tests</title>

  <para>
    Even good programmers make mistakes. The difference between a good
    programmer and a bad programmer is that the good programmer uses tests
    to detect his mistakes as soon as possible. The sooner you test for a
    mistake the greater your chance of finding it and the less it will cost
    to find and fix. This explains why leaving testing until just before
    releasing software is so problematic. Most errors do not get caught at
    all, and the cost of fixing the ones you do catch is so high that you
    have to perform triage with the errors because you just cannot afford
    to fix them all.

    <indexterm><primary>Unit Test</primary></indexterm>

    Testing with PHPUnit is not a totally different activity from what you
    should already be doing. It is just a different way of doing it. The
    difference is between <emphasis>testing</emphasis>, that is, checking
    that your program behaves as expected, and <emphasis>performing a battery
    of tests</emphasis>, runnable code-fragments that automatically test the
    correctness of parts (units) of the software. These runnable
    code-fragments are called unit tests.
  </para>

  <para>
    In this chapter we will go from simple <literal>print</literal>-based
    testing code to a fully automated test. Imagine that we have been asked
    to test PHP's built-in <literal>array</literal>. One bit of functionality
    to test is the function <literal>count()</literal>. For a newly created
    array we expect the <literal>count()</literal> function to return
    <literal>0</literal>. After we add an element, <literal>count()</literal>
    should return <literal>1</literal>.
    <xref linkend="automating-tests.examples.array-test.php" /> shows what
    we want to test.
  </para>

  <example id="automating-tests.examples.array-test.php">
    <title>Testing array operations</title>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[<?php
$fixture = array();
// $fixture is expected to be empty.

$fixture[] = 'element';
// $fixture is expected to contain one element.
?>]]></programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>
    A really simple way to check whether we are getting the results we
    expect is to print the result of <literal>count()</literal> before
    and after adding the element (see
    <xref linkend="automating-tests.examples.array-test2.php" />).
    If we get <literal>0</literal> and then <literal>1</literal>,
    <literal>array</literal> and <literal>count()</literal> behave as
    expected.
  </para>

  <example id="automating-tests.examples.array-test2.php">
    <title>Using print to test array operations</title>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[<?php
$fixture = array();
print count($fixture) . "\n";

$fixture[] = 'element';
print count($fixture) . "\n";
?>]]></programlisting>
    <screen>0
1</screen>
  </example>

  <para>
    Now, we would like to move from tests that require manual interpretation
    to tests that can run automatically. In
    <xref linkend="automating-tests.examples.array-test3.php" />, we write
    the comparison of the expected and actual values into the test code and
    print <literal>ok</literal> if the values are equal. If we ever see a
    <literal>not ok</literal> message, we know something is wrong.
  </para>

  <example id="automating-tests.examples.array-test3.php">
    <title>Comparing expected and actual values to test array operations</title>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[<?php
$fixture = array();
print count($fixture) == 0 ? "ok\n" : "not ok\n";

$fixture[] = 'element';
print count($fixture) == 1 ? "ok\n" : "not ok\n";
?>]]></programlisting>
    <screen>ok
ok</screen>
  </example>

  <para>
    <indexterm><primary>Assertions</primary></indexterm>

    We now factor out the comparison of expected and actual values into a
    function that raises an Exception when there is a discrepancy
    (<xref linkend="automating-tests.examples.array-test4.php" />). This
    gives us two benefits: the writing of tests becomes easier and we only
    get output when something is wrong.
  </para>

  <example id="automating-tests.examples.array-test4.php">
    <title>Using an assertion function to test array operations</title>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[<?php
$fixture = array();
assertTrue(count($fixture) == 0);

$fixture[] = 'element';
assertTrue(count($fixture) == 1);

function assertTrue($condition)
{
    if (!$condition) {
        throw new Exception('Assertion failed.');
    }
}
?>]]></programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>
    <indexterm><primary>Automated Test</primary></indexterm>

    The test is now completely automated. Instead of just
    <emphasis>testing</emphasis> as we did with our first version,
    with this version we have an <emphasis>automated test</emphasis>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The goal of using automated tests is to make fewer mistakes. While your
    code will still not be perfect, even with excellent tests, you will
    likely see a dramatic reduction in defects once you start automating
    tests. Automated tests give you justified confidence in your code. You
    can use this confidence to take more daring leaps in design
    (Refactoring), get along with your teammates better (Cross-Team Tests),
    improve relations with your customers, and go home every night with
    proof that the system is better now than it was this morning because of
    your efforts.
